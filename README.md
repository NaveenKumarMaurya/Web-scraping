#### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a web scraping solution to extract data from the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) website. Maharashtra RERA maintains a comprehensive database of registered real estate projects in the state. By scraping this data, we aim to collect information on various real estate projects, such as their details, approvals, status, and developers, for further analysis and decision-making.
